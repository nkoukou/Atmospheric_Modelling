Temporarily, issues are listed below:
-------------------------------------

papers / GIT (priority) / bash scripting
----
ToDo:

1. exported graphs (colorbar consistent color, space between subplots)

1. find (lat, lon) that correspond to sea level and study altitude
2. Request all overlapping years (be careful with size)
3. Make the necessary 3D fields (pay attention to temperature avging)
4. How to import 3D fields in libradtran

1. Find derivative of array
2. Wrap up code for matter entropy
3. Include LW
