Entropy and intensity calculations

Temporarily, issues are listed below:
-------------------------------------

read papers (FELDMAN) / GIT (priority) / bash scripting

----
ToDo:

why sw_flux is so different than lres_sw_flux?
more graph types
analyse graphs (more functions to compare them, physical reasoning,...)
analyse gm data
--
Code Qs:

numerical integration?
efficiency?
negative values in OSSE data? *1000 correction? conditions when data taken?
why log lambda in entropy.pro?
why SW&LW so different in joint plotin entropy.py?
