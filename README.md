Entropy and intensity calculations

Temporarily, issues are listed below:
-------------------------------------
papers / GIT (priority) / bash scripting
-------------------------------------
ToDo:

1. Request one overlapping years
2. Check out lowtran vs reptran vs source file inputs
3. Keep notes and comments of all assumptions and calculations
4. Calculate sza theoretically
5. Request many overlapping years (be careful with size)
6. Check time evolution
7. Make the necessary 3D fields (make netcdf file out of netcdf avging)
8. mat_ent.py (deriv function, calculations, plots, output files)
9. exported graphs (colorbar consistency, framing)
