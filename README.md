Entropy and intensity calculations

Temporarily, issues are listed below:
-------------------------------------

read papers (FELDMAN) / bash scripting / unix / GIT (priority)

----
glob_ent.py Qs:

why stand alone calculations of entropy differ from function?
check this ^ with entropy.py
check this ^ with fluxes
check numpy errors (div by 0 etc.)
--
entropy.py Qs:

what does lres mean?
why *1000 correction?
why log lambda?
why SW&LW so different in joint plot?
